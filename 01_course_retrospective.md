## 1. What went well
- I was confident with some of the front-end coding in **react-native** compared to other more back-end coding. I like what I've done with our application project as the **SQA** of the group.

- I have mastered none of the lessons but I have learned enough to have some knowledge moving forward.

---

## 2. What went wrong / Challenges
- I had challenges remembering most lessons that reflects my examination results. I also had some problems being the **QA** such as being on the right time schedule to work. 
- The largest obstacle I had was staying on schedule as the groups QA as I have my own personal weaknesses and our group had some problems.

## 3. Key Learnings
- I gained much more in web developing on the front-end side of things such as using **bootstrap** and **tailwind** and implementing it in **react**( as it has it's own format of coding)
- I learned the importance of **multiple pushes** if you are pushing code to github so that you and your team members may recall certain points if somehow the code becomes broken or bugs arise before coding.

## 4. Areas for Improvement
- Practice **not relying on AI** too much that I have nothing to present if I was told to give a code line( like that of our examination)
- Enhance **CSS and layout skills**, especially for responsive designs.  
- Work on my **time management skill** to avoid last-minute issues during group projects.

## 5. Expectations for Mobile Development (AppDev2)
- I want to learn how does mobile development actually work that differentiates it from web application development.
- I want to understand **Expo tools**, mobile navigation, and best practices for mobile UI/UX.  
- I aim to become comfortable with **TypeScript** as we transition from JavaScript.  
- I want to learn how to adjust my **QA** skills to cater to that of a mobile application
